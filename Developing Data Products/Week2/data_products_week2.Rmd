## Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown and Leaflet


Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.
Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

 Webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!
