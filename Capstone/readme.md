Word Prediction Project is a Shiny app based on R code that uses a text prediction algorithm to predict the next words based on text entered by a user.

The data is from a corpus called HC Corpora (www.corpora.heliohost.org). See the readme file at http://www.corpora.heliohost.org/aboutcorpus.html for details on the corpora available.

Workflow

1. Getting and cleaning data (remove numbers, punctuation, whitespaces).
2. Building models - Used Basic n-gram model.
3. Review of dataset.
4. Build model for prediction of next word.
5. Publish model using the Shiny interface
